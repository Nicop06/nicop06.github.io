My name is Nicolas Porcel.  I am currently a Software Engineer at [Isomorphic
Labs][], reimagining drug discovery using AI. Before that, I was working at
[DeepMind][]. If you want to know more about my curriculum, you can download my
[CV][].

I am passionate about Open Source technologies, and especially Linux.  This
blog is mainly about programming and the different projects I am working on.

Feel free to contact me if you have any question:

* You can follow me on [Twitter][], although I am not very active.
* You can see my contributions and projects on [Github][].
* I occasionally help people on [Stack Overflow][].
* You also can connect with me on [LinkedIn][].
* I sometimes connect to [Freenode][] under the alias *Nicop06*.
