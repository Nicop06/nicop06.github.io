My name is Nicolas Porcel.  I am currently a Software Engineer
[DeepMind](www.deepmind.com).  Before that, I studied at
[Supelec](http://www.supelec.fr/), a French engineering school.  If you
want to know more about my curriculum, you can download my
[CV](/files/cv-nporcel.pdf).

I am passionate about Open Source technologies, and especially Linux.  This
blog is mainly about programming and the different projects I am working on.

Feel free to contact me if you have any question:

* You can follow me on [Twitter][], although I am not very active.
