My name is Nicolas Porcel. I am currently a Software Engineer [Amadeus](www.amadeus.com). Before that, I studied at [Supelec](http://www.supelec.fr/), a French engineering school. If you want to know more about my curriculum, you can download my [CV](cv-nporcel.pdf).

I am passioned about Open Source technologies, and especially Linux. I currently am running [Archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org) and [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) on my personal laptop. As a developer, I find a lot of benefits to using an Open Source system, such as having full control of your system, the flexibility in its configuration and the freedom of choosing the software that best fit my needs.

But there are also benefits if you are not a developer. You do not depend on a big organization. The Open Source community is built by regular people all around the world. You can directly talk to the developers of the software you use everyday to suggest new improvements. You can help by writing documentation and solve some problems others may face. You are not only user of the software, you can also become actor.

As you probably understood by reading this introduction, this blog will be mainly about Linux, Open Source technology and programming. It will be also a way of sharing my different projects. Fill free to contact me if you have any question.
